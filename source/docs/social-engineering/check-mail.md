# Detecting fake emails and phishing

## Basically

* Look closely at the ‘from’ field.
* Verify message source.
* Check the reply email.
* Reply and wait for the result.

## Phishing & email 

* Be wary of emails asking for confidential information.
* Don't get pressured into providing sensitive information. Phishers like to use [all kinds of social engineering](attack-trees:docs/social-engineering/README). Learn what you can about it.
* Check a website's privacy policy, especially whether it will or will not sell its mailing list. If so, do not register.
* Watch out for generic-looking requests for information.
* Never submit confidential information via forms embedded within email messages.
* Never use links in an email to connect to a website unless you are absolutely sure they are authentic.
