# Browsers

Many of the browser vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks and abuses mentioned need to be fixed by the developers of browsers and web applications, which aren’t much under the direct control of users, but users are not entirely powerless.

* Use Safari: Apple has given [Safari built-in privacy features](https://www.fastcompany.com/40581691/all-the-people-apple-just-pissed-off-to-better-protect-your-privacy) that other web browsers are not and are unlikely to ever offer: stopping advertisers from tracking you around the web, stopping Facebook and Google from tracking your browsing history via like and share buttons, and stopping websites from identifying you by “fingerprinting,” a technique that uses your device’s unique digital signature to identify it online. Safari also lets you manage if websites can gain access to your camera and microphone.
* Use the rest of [safer browsing](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/README) also.
* Use [networked or single-point anonymisers](data-mitigations:docs/traffic/README) to obscure identifying information.
