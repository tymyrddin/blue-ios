# Install a third party scanner

iOS has several built-in security features to protect your device from malware threats. There have been instances of 
iPhone security breaches, but most of these happened due to pirated software or jailbreaking.

iOS security apps cannot act as traditional "antivirus" scanners. Since iPhone apps are sandboxed, an app can't 
access the data for another app. As a result, you won't find any iOS offerings that can scan your device for malware. 
And these apps can't protect you from other threats, like phishing emails disguised as Apple ID alerts.
