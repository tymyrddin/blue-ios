# Introduction

iOS malware is not as common as malware for other devices, but any device always has a risk of getting infected. Phones contain more sensitive information than PC's and Workstations. It usually contains pictures, credit cards, private messages, and other valuable data. 

Mobile malware is a generic term for malicious software designed to target mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, and iOT devices) with the goal of gaining access to private data.

Apparently it is still not as pervasive as malware that attacks traditional workstations, and that may have to do with the fact that SOC teams and SIEM stacks have focused mostly on detecting workstation and corporate network threats (before Covid and the BYOD wave), and that it was only a matter of time before hackers switched tactics.

It is definitely [a recognised growing threat and needs to be addressed](https://pap.tymyrddin.dev/docs/notes/readme).
