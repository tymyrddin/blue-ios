# Introduction

iOS malware is not as common as for other devices, but it always has a risk of getting infected. 

Indicators of malware or virus infection:

* Your battery is draining faster than normal
* Your phone is behaving abnormally
* You find strange apps being installed on your device, automatically
* Your device is getting heated up too quickly
* Your device may show you some kind of warning message
* Increase in data usage
* There may be calls you did not make or text messages you did not send

If your iPhone shows these symptoms, you can [maybe find the bugger and remove it](clean-machine.md)
