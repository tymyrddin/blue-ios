# ';--have i been pwned?

[';--have i been pwned? (HIBP)](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a database of several billion email addresses (and, separately, passwords) that have appeared in a publicly known past data breach. 

Firefox Monitor is an online service developed by Mozilla It informs users if their email address and passwords used have been leaked in data breaches, using the database provided by Have I Been Pwned?

Check if you have an account that has been compromised in a data breach, and if so, change your password and change it in any other place where youâ€™ve used that password. Better yet, never use a password twice, and consider using a password manager.
