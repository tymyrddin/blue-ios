# Using email more securely

* Do not use public computers to access email with sensitive information.
* If you are not in a safe neighbourhood, [use a VPN](../services/vpn.md) or [Tor anonymity network](../services/tor-proxy.md) to encrypt traffic 
from the user machine to a safer network.
* Use [privacy-focused email services](../services/email-services.md), and have at least two email addresses, one for private use, and one for public use,  (and do not use your own name or other personal information)
* GPG, PGP, SMEmail, can be used for end-to-end message encryption. [But note that it can defeat other defenses](https://pap.tymyrddin.dev/docs/prevention/encryption).
