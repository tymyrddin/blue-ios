# Silence spam callers

Spam and robocalls are a major problem, everywhere. If you are driven insane:

* Go to Settings -> Phone and scroll down until you see the “Silence Unknown Callers” toggle. 
* Tap this switch, so it is on (green)

From now on, until you undo it, all calls from unknown numbers (those not in your Contacts) will be silenced for good.
