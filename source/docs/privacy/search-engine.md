# Changing default search engine

By default, Safari uses Googleâ€™s search engine to return results when you do a web search. Google pays Apple billions every year for it to be the default search engine. And Apple also allows you to choose a different search engine, including offering the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo (its business model does not rely on collecting data about you).

* Go to ***Settings -> Safari -> Search Engine***.
* Tap ***DuckDuckGo***.
