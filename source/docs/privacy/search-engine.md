# Change your search engine

By default, Safari uses Google’s search engine to return results when you do a web search. Google pays Apple billions 
every year to be the default search engine. But Apple also allows you to choose a different search engine, including 
offering the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo (its business model doesn’t rely on collecting data about you).

* Go to Settings -> Safari -> Search Engine 
* Tap DuckDuckGo
