# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting 
protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* [Ungoogled Chromium browser](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) is an open source project to provide a Chromium browser, without the Google privacy issues.
* [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) is a Chromium-based browser for Android only (no desktop support). It comes with some great features by default, including ad blocking and various privacy enhancements.
* [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is a fork of Firefox focused on privacy, security, and freedom, only available for desktop operating systems.
* Out of the "big" and "mainstream" browsers, Safari is more secure. You will still have to increase your data privacy and security while using Safari.

If the browser you choose is not secure and privacy-friendly, [lock down the browser and the software it can invoke](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/README).
