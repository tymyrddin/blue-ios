# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting 
protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* Out of the "big" and "mainstream" browsers, Safari is more secure. You will still have to increase your data privacy and security while using Safari.

If the browser you choose is not secure and privacy-friendly, [lock down the browser and the software it can invoke](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/README).
