# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting 
protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* [Oion browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448) enables you to use Tor 
without needing to install the [Tor proxy](tor-proxy.md). It is open source, uses Tor routing, and is developed by 
someone who works closely with the Tor Project. However, Apple requires browsers on iOS to use something called Webkit, 
which prevents Onion Browser from having the same privacy protections as Tor Browser. Tor Browser is not in the Apple 
Store.
* Out of the "big" and "mainstream" browsers, Safari is more secure. If you continue to use it, you will still have to 
increase your data privacy and security while using Safari.

If the browser you choose is not secure and privacy-friendly, [lock down the browser and the software it can invoke](data-mitigations:docs/browsing/README).
