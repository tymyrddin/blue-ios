# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [DuckDuckGo Private Browser](https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361?pt=866401&mt=8) offers seamless protection while you search and browse - plus access to free tracking protection for your email inbox, secure password management, new beta features, and more.
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* [Onion browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448) enables you to use Tor without needing to install the [Tor proxy](tor-proxy.md). It is open source, uses Tor routing, and is developed by someone who works closely with the Tor Project. However, Apple requires browsers on iOS to use something called Webkit, which prevents Onion Browser from having the same privacy protections as Tor Browser. Tor Browser is not in the Apple Store.
* Out of the "big" and "mainstream" browsers, Safari is more secure. If you continue to use it, you will still have to increase your data privacy and security while using Safari.

If the browser you choose is less secure and privacy-friendly, lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
