* Internet providers are collecting your browsing data and handing this over to third parties (US, UK, Australia, and most of Europe). 
* Public Wi-Fi remains a serious threat with adversaries targeting unsuspecting users.
* Many streaming services and websites restrict content to certain geographic locations. A VPN allows you to bypass such restrictions (Not always. Some such websites keep blacklists of VPN servers and will still block your traffic).

A VPN will encrypt the connection and make the traffic unreadable. VPNs not logging traffic, DNS requests, timestamps, bandwidth, IP address:
