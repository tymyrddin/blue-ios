# Change your browser app

iOS devices come with Apple’s Safari browser pre-installed, but you can use a different browser if you 
wish. Unfortunately, on older iOS versions (< 14), you can’t set a different browser as the default, so when you 
tap links in emails or messages, Safari will open them—but most apps let you lightly tap-and-hold on links to copy 
the address to paste it into an [alternative browser of your choice](browsers.md).

If you’re running iOS 14, iPadOS 14, or higher, you can set any third-party browser as the default on your iPhone or 
iPad.

* Install your replacement browser app.
* In the Settings menu, locate the section for the browser you’d like to set as your default.
* If it has been updated to support Apple’s default browser switching feature, you will find a “Default Browser App” 
option in its settings. 
* Tap to make it the default. A checkmark appears to confirm it's the default.
