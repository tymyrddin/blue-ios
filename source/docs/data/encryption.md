# Encrypting the data

Appleâ€™s iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad smart devices all support basic built-in encryption when a passcode is enabled.

To enable encryption:

* ***Settings -> Face ID & Passcode***
* Make sure passcode is enabled.
* Data protection is enabled should be displayed at the bottom of the Face ID & Passcode screen.

iOS' data encryption does not prevent authorities from accessing your backup on Apple's servers.
