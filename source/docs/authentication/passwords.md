# Automagically create strong passwords

Next time you create an account in an app or at a website, when you select the “Create password” field, you’ll now see 
iOS has automatically inserted a unique password in the field. Tap the “Use Strong Password” button to use the 
recommended password, and iOS will automatically store it in your Keychain. iOS never generates the same strong 
password twice.
