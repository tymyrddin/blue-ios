# Automagically creating strong passwords

If not on:

1. Go to ***Settings -> Passwords -> Password Options***.
2. Turn on ***AutoFill Passwords***.

Next time you create an account in an app or at a website, when you select the ***Create password*** field, youâ€™ll see iOS has automatically inserted a unique password in the field. Tap the ***Use Strong Password*** button to use the recommended password, and iOS will automatically store it in your ***Keychain***. iOS never generates the same strong password twice.
