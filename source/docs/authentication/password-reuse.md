# Auditing and changing password reuse

Password reuse is a security problem. With password reuse auditing you can see which websites you’ve reused passwords on and then give them unique passwords. The real advantage is that it visualizes how vulnerable reusing the same password on multiple sites makes, and creates unique strong passwords for every site and app you use.

* Go to ***Settings -> Passwords & Accounts -> Website & App Passwords***. This is where the ***Keychain*** is located. 
* Authenticate, and you’ll be taken to a list of app and site passwords.
* Any site or app that has an exclamation mark in a triangle next to it means you are also using its password for another site or app.
* Tap the symbol
* Change Password on Website
* This will take you to that site's password management screen where you can change your password.
